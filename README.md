# Where-Should-I-Live

## In these unprecedented timesâ€¦

Given the massive number of history changing events that have happened in the last 12 months many people have found themselves asking just this question. This project aims to provide a simple way for people to find cities in the US that fit a given set of criteria to live in.
We will use data from Kaggle and from Numbeo to compare cities across the US with respect to cost of living, consumer prices, crime rates, education, and other factors. We will then recommend to the user the best places that they may want to consider for a future place to live!
